# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This is a sorting visualizer made using the Pygame library. The project allows you to visualize how various sorting algorithms work on a randomly generated list of integers. While sorting, the bars are animated as the elements are compared and swapped. The colors (green and red) indicate which elements are currently being compared and swapped. It's a great tool to understand sorting algorithms better through a graphical representation!

# Features: 
- Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort <br />

- Interactive UI: Control the sorting process with intuitive keyboard inputs <br />

- Ascending or Descending Sorting: Choose between sorting the list in ascending or descending order <br />

- Real-Time Visualization: Watch each sorting step in action, with comparisons and swaps highlighted <br />

- Customizable List: Modify the number of elements and their value range to observe different scenarios <br />

# How to Use
1. Clone the repository <br />
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
```
2. Install Pygame by running: <br />
```
pip install pygame
```
3. Run the Program <br />
Once pygame is installed,  navigate to the project folder and run the program:
```
python sorting_visualizer.py
```
# Controls
- R - Reset the list with new random values
- Space - Start the sorting algorithm
- A - Sort the list in ascending order
- D - Sort the list in descending order
- B - Select Bubble Sort as the sorting algorithm
- I - Select Insertion Sort as the sorting algorithm
- M - Select Merge Sort as the sorting algorithm
- S - Select Selection Sort as the sorting algorithm
- Q - Select Quick Sort as the sorting algorithm
# Customization
- Number of elements: Modify the n variable in the main() function to change how many elements will be in the list
- Value Range: Adjust the min and max variables in the main() function to control the range of values in the list
